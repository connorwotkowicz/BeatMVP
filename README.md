# üéØ Project Overview: Beat Sequencer App

## Goal:
Create a collaborative beat sequencer using React, Tone.js, PostgreSQL, and CSS to allow users to create and play back music patterns in real-time.

## Core Features:
- **User Authentication** (JWT-based)
- **Collaborative Grid** (step sequencer with 16 steps and 4 rows of sounds)
- **Tone.js Integration** (for sound playback)
- **Playback Control** (start/stop, playback of created patterns)
- **Grid State Management** (toggle steps for different instruments)
- **Backend** (Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL to store patterns)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack:

- **Frontend**: React, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Sound Synthesis**: Tone.js (for sound generation)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## üì¶ Features and Tasks Breakdown

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Authentication and Authorization**

#### Login/Register:
- Create user registration and login forms.
- Use JWT tokens for user authentication.
- Ensure protected routes are accessible only when authenticated.

#### Tasks:
- Set up a login route (`/api/auth/login`) and register route (`/api/auth/register`).
- Implement JWT-based authentication middleware to protect routes like `/account`.

#### Frontend:
- Create `LoginForm` and `RegisterForm` components.
- Use controlled form inputs for validation.
- Handle login state and store JWT in local storage.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Sequencer Grid & Tone.js Integration**

#### Grid Layout:
- Create a 4x16 grid with buttons representing each instrument and time step.
- Each button toggles the on/off state for that step and instrument.

#### Tone.js:
- Load sound samples (e.g., kick, snare, hihat, clap) using `Tone.Player()`.
- Set up `Tone.Transport` to handle playback timing and synchronize the grid‚Äôs playback with a 16-step rhythm.

#### Tasks:
- In the `SequencerGrid` component, map through the grid state and generate buttons.
- Set up Tone.js players for each sound.
- Implement the grid toggle functionality to turn sounds on/off for each step.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Collaborative Features (Future Optional Enhancement)**

#### Real-time Collaboration (Optional):
- Allow multiple users to collaborate on the same pattern using WebSockets or Firebase.
- Track each user‚Äôs changes in real time (i.e., when one user toggles a step, it updates for everyone).

#### Tasks:
- Implement real-time syncing (for the future).
- Store user-specific patterns in the backend database.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Backend & Database**

#### PostgreSQL:
- Create a database with tables for storing users and patterns.
- Patterns will be stored with a user ID to associate them with the correct user.

#### Endpoints:
- `POST /api/patterns`: Save a new pattern.
- `GET /api/patterns`: Fetch saved patterns for a user.

#### Tasks:
- Set up backend with Node.js and Express.
- Create routes to handle pattern saving/loading.
- Use `pg` library to interact with PostgreSQL.
